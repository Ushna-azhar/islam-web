        <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Salah, also known as prayer, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and holds great significance in the life of a Muslim. It is a direct form of worship and communication with Allah, offering believers an opportunity to seek guidance, express gratitude, and ask for forgiveness. Through the regular performance of Salah, Muslims maintain their spiritual connection with Allah and reinforce the discipline, humility, and mindfulness essential for a balanced life. Salah also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of this world and the ultimate purpose of life – to seek Allah&apos;s pleasure and strive for a better hereafter.
