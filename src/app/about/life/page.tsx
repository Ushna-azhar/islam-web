              Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in Mecca in 570 CE into the noble Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. He was orphaned at a young age, and was raised by his grandfather, then his uncle, Abu Talib. At the age of 25, he married Khadijah, a wealthy and respected merchant who was 15 years older than him. His prophethood began at the age of 40 when he received the first revelation from Allah, marking the start of a mission that would last for 23 years. During this period, he faced tremendous hardships, from persecution to social and economic boycotts, yet he remained steadfast in his mission to spread the message of Islam.
